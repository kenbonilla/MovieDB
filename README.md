# MovieDB
Example of PHP SQL queries, educational purposes only

Database is populated with randomly generated actor/director names, user names, movie titles, cast, user likes/dislikes, etc.
Use this as a base to play with PHP and SQL. For demonstration purposes, each query was placed on its own page. Use the skeleton.php file as a template, just plop your own php in the body and the headers, footers, menus, etc. are taken care of. After all, this is for learning SQL, not HTML!
